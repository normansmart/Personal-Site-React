                    <h2> BACKGROUND </h2>
                    <p> When dorming in college, myself and my roommates bickered quite a bit over how to manage our
                        responsibilities to our shared living space. I had the benefit of being good friends with all of
                        them but that didnâ€™t stop us from having serious problems as roommates.
                    </p>

                    <p> I had seen and heard many different complaints and critiques from others about their rooming
                        experience and sought to figure a way to address this.
                    </p>

                            <p>I spoke to various different types of people. Their sub-backgrounds came in a variety of
                                cultures and experiences and I sorted them into groups by their age, gender, occupation and distance to work relative to their home or where they would prefer to live within the tri-state area.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I interviewed 10 people who were in need of a living partner. Additionally, I took surveys
                                of 15 more people within the younger criteria groups on their interests and pain points of
                                living with people or looking for roommates.
                            </p>
